# A demo for the DCC leveraging Buildwise's own data: the meeting rooms usage
This repository contains the files for the server side of the demo, i.e. docker with the code for scraping the gobright web page, getting the information, and pushing it to a postgres DB.

A second repository contains the client side, i.e. the Unity application.
